Synopsis
========

| xss-lock [-n *notify_cmd*] [--ignore-sleep] [-v|-q] [--] *locker* [*arg*] ...
| xss-lock --help|--version

Description
===========

**xss-lock** hooks up your favorite locker to the MIT screen saver extension
for X and also to systemd's login manager. The locker is executed in response
to events from these two sources:

- X signals when screen saver activation is forced or after a period of user
  inactivity (as set with ``xset s TIMEOUT``). In the latter case, the notifier
  command, if specified, is executed first.

- The login manager can also request that the session be locked; as a result of
  ``loginctl lock-sessions``, for example. Additionally, **xss-lock** uses the
  inhibition logic to lock the screen before the computer goes to sleep.

**xss-lock** waits for the locker to exit -- or kills it when screen saver
deactivation or session unlocking is forced -- so the command should not fork.

Options
=======

-n cmd, --notifier=cmd
                Run *cmd* when the screen saver activates because of user
                inactivity. Shell-style quoting is supported. The notifier is
                killed when X signals user activity or when the locker is
                started. The locker is started after the first screen saver
                cycle, as set with ``xset s TIMEOUT CYCLE``.

                This can be used to run a countdown or (on laptops) dim the
                screen before locking. For an example, see the script
                *@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/doc/xss-lock/dim-screen.sh*.

--ignore-sleep  Do not lock on suspend/hibernate.

-q, --quiet     Output only fatal errors.

-v, --verbose   Output more messages.

-h, --help      Print help message and exit.

--version       Print version number and exit.

Signals
=======

SIGHUP
    Upon receiving this signal, **xss-lock** resets the screen saver, but only
    if the screen is not currently locked (unlike ``xset s reset``).

    This can be used in MPlayer's configuration as a workaround for MPlayer's
    failure to restart the screen saver timer when playback is paused::

        heartbeat-cmd="killall -HUP xss-lock"
        stop-xscreensaver=false

    Note that this is ineffective with mplayer2 (and mpv), because its heart
    keeps beating while playback is paused.

SIGINT/SIGTERM
    Upon receiving this signal, **xss-lock** exits after killing any running
    notifier or locker.

Notes
=====

- Some applications rely on the **xdg-screensaver** script from xdg-utils,
  which uses ``xset s off`` and ``xset s default`` to suspend and resume the
  screen saver, respectively. The latter resets the timeout and cycle to the
  server defaults (``xset s on`` uses a hardcoded default instead), so this
  only works if you like (or can control) the server settings.
  
  To fix the resume action in this script (or a copy in *~/bin* preceding the
  original in **$PATH**), either replace ``on`` by your preferred timeout and
  cycle, or avoid hardcoded time values by patching the script to run a suspend
  loop as it does for other screen savers, using
  *@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/doc/xss-lock/xdg-screensaver.patch*.

Examples
========

- Run **xlock** after ten minutes of inactivity::

    xset 600
    xss-lock -- xlock +resetsaver

  Without ``+resetsaver``, **xlock** forces a screen saver reset during
  startup, thereby telling **xss-lock** to immediately kill **xlock** again.

- Dim the screen after three minutes of inactivity, lock the screen two minutes
  later using **i3lock**::

    xset 180 120
    xss-lock -n dim-screen.sh -- i3lock -n
